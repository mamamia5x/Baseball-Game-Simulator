# [Baseball Game Simulator](https://github.com/mamamia5x/Baseball-Game-Simulator)
A baseball game simulator, written in JS.  

To play a game, you first need to have `teamdata`. `teamdata` is the ratings for the two baseball teams. The teams are ranked in 5 categories, those being batting, power, pitching, defense and speed. Each category is ranked on a scale of 1-15 (decimals allowed).

Teamdata can be set two ways, by editing the file `teamdata.json`, or by uploading a csv file, naming it `teamdata.csv` and then running the command `npm run convert` or `node converter.js`. This'll convert the csv file into a json file, allowing the script to read the team data.

Playing a game is simple, just run the command `npm run start` or `node index.js`. It'll simulate the game and put the results in the `output.txt` file.

You don't need NPM to run this script, but Node should be installed. You can run it online at repl.it.

**Note**: CSV file should look like

![CSV](other/csvlooks.png)
```csv
Teams,City,Name,Batting,Power,Pitching,Defense,Speed
Team 1,Test,Name,11,8,2,7,10
Team 2,Foo,Bar,10,5,5,10,7
```

Team ratings were generated by me, using stats of the regular season. Obviously, these ratings aren't 100% accurate.

# 2021 MLB World Series Simulation
